<font size = 7><center><b><u>About Story Validator Watcher</u></b></center></font>
-  Cosmos Validator Watcher is set to streamline monitoring and interaction with Cosmos-based blockchains and validators by [Kiln](https://github.com/kilnfi/cosmos-validator-watcher).
-  This custom tool does not allow you to receive data from the blockchain in real time and distribute it to the watcher.
-  Therefore, our team wrote [pars_script](https://github.com/endorphinestake/story-validator-watcher/tree/main/pars_script) which adds active validators to the watcher configuration in real time.
